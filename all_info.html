                <p>It is crucial to provide age appropriate information when discussing COVID-19 with dependants. It is important to stay <span class="highlight">calm, honest and reassuring when talking</span> as dependants can worry about themselves as well as their family and their friends (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). It is essential as a responsible adult, that you are helping your dependents make sense of these unprecedented times. You can do this by communicating with your dependents in an honest, accurate and age appropriate manner.</p>
                <p>If you would like to access your personalised information package, please follow the link below to enter your dependant's age.</p>

                <h1>Importance of speaking to your dependant about COVID-19</h1>
                <p class='personalised-info-text'>During the pandemic, it is crucial to be communicating effectively to your dependant about COVID-19. Responsible adults are in the unique position to share information that they have uncovered as well as confirming any information the dependant has heard in an age appropriate, yet accurate manner. Often, responsible adults <span class="highlight">lie or manipulate the truth to protect their dependants</span> from information they perceive as harmful. Responsible adults may see their white lies as a method of protecting their dependants from the realities of COVID-19 and its effects. However, these lies and the manipulation of truth may lead to long term psychological damage in dependants (Dalton, Rapa & Stein, 2020). </p>

                <div>
                  <h3>Infant (0 - 1)</h3>
                  <p>Dependants who are Infants (0 - 1) will not be able to converse and gather information for themselves. However, they will notice a significant change in routine or if you are highly stressed or anxious during this time (Emerging Minds, 2020). It is important as a responsible adult that you try to focus on your infant and their needs as well as your own mental health.</p>
                  <h3>Toddler (1 - 3)</h3>
                  <p>Dependants who are in the Toddler (1 - 3) bracket are beginning to develop emotionally and will be feeling emotions such as frustration, anger, guilt and shame (Raising Children, 2020). Toddlers are also developing their thinking and are beginning to understand various concepts like opposites (Raising Children, 2020). Dependants at this age are able to follow simple instructions and this can be used when discussing COVID-19 with your Toddler.</p>
                  <h3>Preschooler (3 - 5)</h3>
                  <p>Dependants in the Preschool (3 - 5) bracket are learning their independence. Reading to your dependant and encouraging language skills through using full sentences are integral to this phase of development  (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). A Preschooler will begin to question the world around them and may come to you with lots of questions about the current pandemic.</p>
                  <h3>Middle Childhood (6 - 11)</h3>
                  <p>Dependants in Middle Childhood (6 - 11) are commonly exposed to many sources of information through interactions with the community and those around them. Those in middle childhood begin to have concern for others and think about the future (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Dependants of this age bracket may experience increased anxiety and stress during the pandemic. It is important that you are reassuring and answering their questions when discussing COVID-19 with your dependant.</p>
                  <h3>Young Teen (12 - 14)</h3>
                  <p>Dependants in the Young Teen (12 - 14) bracket are experiencing physical, mental, emotional and social changes. These changes can affect their confidence and mood (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). It is important that you are honest and direct with your dependent about various topics, but you also encourage them to make their own choices and decisions. Whilst discussing COVID-19, be respectful of their thoughts, concerns and emotions that may arise due to the pandemic.</p>
                  <h3>Teenager (15 - 17)</h3>
                  <p>Dependants in the Teenager bracket (15 - 17) are more likely to judge the information they encounter themselves. Often, they will form their own opinion before talking to you. Dependants in this age bracket will spend more time with their friends rather than their responsible adult (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). However, it is important that you talk with your teens and you develop solutions to problems together.</p>
