                    <p class='tips-examples-age-paragraph'>Like adults, dependants in middle childhood are also exposed to a large amount of information and often it is difficult to sort through fact, fiction and what is unknown (Emerging Minds, 2020). Dependants in Middle Childhood can often be confused by the information they have found or heard from various sources often, <span class="highlight">they will come to you with clarifying questions or to help them understand what is happening</span> (Emerging Minds, 2020). It is ok to not have the answers to their questions. <span class="highlight">Take this as an opportunity to find the information out together</span> (Victorian Government, 2020).</p>
                    <p class='tips-examples-age-paragraph'>It is essential that when discussing COVID-19 with your dependant you understand their worries and are able to share accurate and age appropriate information. For this reason <span class="highlight">you should actively seek reliable information to help you to respond to your dependants questions</span>. You can do this by choosing organisation websites such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Australian Department of health.</p>
